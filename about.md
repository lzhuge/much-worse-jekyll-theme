I am an economics doctoral student at Boston University. My research interests concern both development and labor economics. Prior to entering Boston University, I earned my Bachelor's degree in economics from Zhejiang University in China. Post-graduation, I worked as a Research Assistant with the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, MA. Currently, I have research projects concerning variable  Chinese firm dynamics and the policy implications that result. You can contact me by my email below for questions, comments, and/or opportunities.
