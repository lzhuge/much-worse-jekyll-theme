I am a PhD student in economics at Boston University. My research interests are in development economics and econometrics. Prior to entering Boston University, I earned Bachelor's degree in Economics from Zhejiang University and worked as a Research Assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, MA. Currently, I am working on a project concerning dynamics of hi-tech companies located at a science park in Beijing. You can contact me by information shown on my CONTACT tag.
