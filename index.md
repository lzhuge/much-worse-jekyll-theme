I am a PhD candidate in economics at Boston University. My research interests are in development economics and econometrics. Prior to entering Boston University, I earned Bachelor's degree in economics from Zhejiang University and worked as a Research Assistant at the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, MA. At the NBER, my research focused on the relationship between environmental regulations and innovation abilities of firms. Currently, I am working on a project concerning dynamics of hi-tech companies. From Feb. 2018 to Jun. 2018, I am visiting the University of Melbourne.
